Beginner HTML/CSS development reference site 
This is a work in progress, I will be building it as I learn.
I have already created several pages, but will bring the code over gradually. It has issues that need to be worked out as well as content orginization. 
The initial code I have started here also has a few issues I need to work out.
It was just a quick job to see how these git pages work. 
The end goal is to create a website for beginners that really gives the basic info to get one started.
What I mean by this, is that through the journey I have been on to learn web development, There are too many "teasers" to cause you to get off track. Sure they are nice to know about, but but really just a distraction when you are first learning.
My aim is to start with what the real minimum is for creating an actual page. The minimum html and css code need to show some visual style, as well as what is needed in order to keep things placed where they are expected to be.
It's a start.
